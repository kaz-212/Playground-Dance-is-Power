# Playground: Dance is Power

Messing around with spline and 3d interactivity in the browser.
Here you'll find a girl dancing with the lighting illuminating her following the cursor.

## To run locally 

`cd` into root directory

``` bash
nvm install # to install and use the correct version of node/npm
npm ci
npm run dev # to create a dev server on localhost where you can interact 
```
***note**: this project uses React as I was initially intending it to be a bigger/more complicated project. I would've just used vanilla js if I were to start from scratch.*
